###  Data Preprocessing

There is a sample Python implementation of Data Preprocessing step in any ML aglorithms. 

In the preprocessing step we will have following actions on the data 

**Step 1:** Read data using panda or some other library

**Step 2:** Apply rules on missing data like `replace with some value` or `drop the row`

**Step 3:** (Optional) Convert `text/categorical` data to numerical form and vice versa

**Step 4:** Splitting the dataset to `training set` and `test set`

**Step 5:** Scale the features by applying `Normalization` or `MinMax`
