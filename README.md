## Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation

My attempt to implement ML algorithms in python, panda, numpy and sklearn

I am not going to implement all algorithms but will try to cover simplest algorithms first before enter into complex one

**Note: ** All algorithms require a standard data preprocessing step which covered in details

**1: Data Preprocessing **

**2. Regression **

**3. Classification **

**4. Clustering **

**5. Reinforcement Learning **

**6. Natural Language processing **

**7. Dimensionality Reduction **

**Note: ** Deep learning we will cover in as a different projects
