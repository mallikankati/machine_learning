## Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation

My attempt to implement ML algorithms in python, panda, numpy and sklearn

I am not going to implement all algorithms but will try to cover simplest algorithms first before dig into complex one

**Note:**  All algorithms require a standard data preprocessing step which covered in details

**1: Data Preprocessing**

Any ML algorithm require a data preprocessing (DP). In this section we cover why do we need DP and for implementation details look under [Data Preprocessing](1_Data_Preprocessing)

Why do we need Data Preprocessing

  - data file may comes with missing data, in that case come up with uniform replacement (or dropping row ) for missing in given column.
  - If the data contains `text` and `numbers`, need to convert `text` related columns to numbers before feed into ML
  - If the data is not uniform on given column, need to scale that column by applying `Normalization` or `MinMax`

**2. Regression**

**3. Classification**

**4. Clustering**

**5. Reinforcement Learning**

**6. Natural Language processing**

**7. Dimensionality Reduction**

**Note:** Deep learning we will cover in as a different projects
