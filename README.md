## Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation

My attempt to implement ML algorithms in python, panda, numpy and sklearn

I am not going to implement all algorithms but will try to cover simplest algorithms first before dig into complex one

`**Note:**  All algorithms require a standard data preprocessing step which covered in details`

**1: Data Preprocessing**

**2. Regression**

**3. Classification**

**4. Clustering**

**5. Reinforcement Learning**

**6. Natural Language processing**

**7. Dimensionality Reduction**

`**Note:** Deep learning we will cover in as a different projects`
